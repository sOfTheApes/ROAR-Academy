- comments
	- more then 1/3 lines commented
	- comments describe the line they are on, or if their line is otherwise blank, the next code block
	- if a calculation line or lambda calculus is complicated, use backslash linebreaks to spread it out and comment each component
- variables
	- no shorthand, do not short the hand.
	- camelCase (i dont care what it should be, "_" is lame.)
	- constants are CAPITALS because if you change them i will YELL AT YOU
- code blocks
	- USE TABS! One tab per indentation level.
	- every flow controll must be followed directly after by a new code block with one more level of indentation
	- must have valid syntax.
- other
	- turnery operators exist, use whenever possible
	- no maximum line size
	- all commands get docstrings to explain arguments and returns, as well as basic usage
